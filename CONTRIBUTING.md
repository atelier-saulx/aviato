## Contributing workflow - Maintainers

- Decide what you want to contribute.
- If you want to implement new feature discuss it with our maintainers ([Github Discussions](https://github.com/atelier-saulx/aviato-ui/discussions/new)) before jumping into code.

- Get a code review and fix all issues noticed by maintainers
- If you cannot finish your task or changed your mind – that's totally fine, just let us know in GitHub issue that you've created in first step. Aviato community is friendly – we won't judge or ask any questions if you decide to cancel your submission
