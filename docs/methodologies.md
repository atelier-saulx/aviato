## 🪡 Stitches

Stitches is a CSS-in-JS framework with near-zero runtime, SSR, multi-variant support, and a best-in-class developer experience. It also supports theme tokens — aka. style variables or design tokens — out of the box. See [Tokens](https://stitches.dev/docs/tokens).

## 🔗 React.forwardRef

React forwardRef is a method that allows parent components pass down (i.e., “forward”) refs to their children. Using forwardRef in React gives the child component a reference to a DOM element created by its parent component. This then allows the child to read and modify that element anywhere it is being used.

All UI components implements this, to facilitate developer experience (DX).
